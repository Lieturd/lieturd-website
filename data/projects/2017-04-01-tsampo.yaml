description: Tsampo was a vison for a platform to connect scientists and other
  parties interested in science. With the help of Lieturd, the vision was
  refined into a clear implementation plan. Additionally Lieturd helped Tsampo
  find a capable team to implement it, and provided assistance to build the
  base of the application.
